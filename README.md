# next-level-CXT

CXT (Calidade de Xesti√≥n nas TIC) labs repository.

I will be using a "master node", basically I have deployed a VPS from which I will connect
to all AWS resources and the AWS API itself.

Also to challenge myself, I've allowed only programmatic access to the IAM user I will be using,
with this I will force myself to do everything within Terraform and improve my current skills.

To do the configuration within the instances created, I will use Ansible.
